# Started models for the saved book and the bookshelf
# The table SHOULD be a many-to-many table
# It is not at the moment so I can visualize it
# The table should have the ID of the user which is always the same
# And should reference the ID in the API of the book
# I think getting the ID from the API ID of the book
# would be more consistant because each book has a special ID
# This is because if the same book is saved between
# different users, I don't want the same book listed twice
# with different ID'set
# This way the table will grab the books API ID instead
